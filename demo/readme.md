# NativeScript WebSockets Demo

This is a demo for the cross platform WebSocket library for IOS and Android.  

This code is actually pretty old; and just updated to work on the latest version of NativeScript.   

This demo has been tested as of NativeScript 4.1

### App Settings
- Name: `Anything you want`
- Server: `nativescript.rocks:3000`
   
   
### Information   
This is one of the projects from my book [Getting Started with NativeScript](http://fluentreports.com/blog/?p=205) it actually uses the code to talk to a WebSocket server (code for server in book) which I run on one of my servers for those learning from the book.
